# Living Spec: CrewLoop Dashboard

## Purpose

The CrewLoop dashboard accepts normalized events from multiple agent hook sources and presents them as a unified real-time session view.

## Supported sources

| Source | Config format | Hook events |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `kimi` | TOML array-of-tables (`~/.kimi/config/config.toml`) | `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` |
| `claude` | JSON flat object (`~/.claude/config.json`) | `before_tool_use` / `after_tool_use` |
| `codex` | JSON matcher-array groups (`~/.codex/hooks.json`) | `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` |
| `agy` | JSON matcher-array groups (`~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`, fallback `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/hooks.json`) | `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` |

The `crewloop-shim` binary dispatches on the source name passed as the first positional argument:

```bash
crewloop-shim <kimi|codex|agy|opencode|log-watcher> --default-skill orchestrator
```

For sources whose payloads do not include the event name (such as AGY), the event type can be forced with `--event-type`:

```bash
crewloop-shim agy --default-skill orchestrator --event-type tool_start
```

## Normalization

Each source adapter converts its native payload into `DashboardEvent`:

```typescript
export interface DashboardEvent {
  id: string;
  timestamp: number;
  source: AgentSource;
  session_id: string;
  event_type: EventType; // session_start | session_end | tool_start | tool_end | skill_change
  tool?: string;
  skill?: string;
  detail?: string;
  status?: 'running' | 'success' | 'error';
  duration_ms?: number;
  input?: Record<string, unknown>;
  output?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface ClientEvent {
  id: string;
  timestamp: number;
  event_type: EventType;
  tool?: string;
  detail?: string;
  status?: 'running' | 'success' | 'error';
  duration_ms?: number;
  skill?: string;
  input?: Record<string, unknown>;
  output?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### AGY payload

AGY sends JSON on stdin with camelCase fields. The payload includes `hook_event_name` (`PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse`) and a `toolCall` object on pre events:

```typescript
interface AgyHookPayload {
  hook_event_name?: 'PreToolUse' | 'PostToolUse';
  conversationId?: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  session_id?: string;
  toolName?: string;
  toolCall?: { name?: string; args?: Record<string, unknown> };
  stepIdx?: number;
  error?: string;
}
```

The adapter (`servers/dashboard/src/adapters/agy.ts`) resolves:

- `event_type` from `hook_event_name`.
- `session_id` from `conversationId ?? sessionId ?? session_id`.
- `id` as a deterministic value `agy:${session_id}:${stepIdx}` so pre/post events pair correctly even when the post event does not repeat the tool name.
- `tool` by mapping AGY snake_case names to internal names (`run_command` → `Bash`, `view_file` → `Read`, etc.).
- `detail` by extracting the primary argument for known tools (`CommandLine`, `AbsolutePath`, etc.).
- `skill` when a `Read` (`view_file`) targets a skill file whose path matches `.../skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- `output` on `PostToolUse` from the `error` field when present.

Because AGY does not emit `session_start`, the shim applies the `--default-skill` fallback as a separate `default_skill` field on every AGY event that does not already carry an inferred or explicit skill. The state store only uses `default_skill` when the session has no active skill, so an inferred skill from a `Read` of `SKILL.md` is preserved across subsequent tool calls.

## Security

The shim runs the raw payload through `sanitize()` before forwarding. Dangerous keys and verbose content are stripped so that agent data does not leak to the dashboard UI. The sanitizer accepts object or string `tool_response` values; plain-string responses are converted to a truncated `contentSnippet` so the UI can display them without exposing raw tool output.

### Kimi payload normalization

Kimi sends tool inputs and responses in slightly different shapes from other sources. The sanitizer normalizes them before the UI sees them:

- **Path resolution** checks path-bearing keys including `path`, `file_path`, `filePath`, `AbsolutePath`, `TargetFile`, nested `args.*`, and `operations[].path` arrays case-insensitively.
- **Write/Read tools** preserve and extract snippets or content from `diff`, `contentSnippet`, `content`, `result`, `snippet`, or `output`.
- **Edit tools** produce a unified `diff` from `old_string`/`new_string`, `oldString`/`newString`, or `old`/`new`.
- **Tool responses** preserve safe content keys (`content`, `result`, `contentsnippet`) to render code views and diffs.

## Client views

The dashboard UI is a Vercel-style command center with a persistent sidebar, a top bar, and a main content area. It exposes seven views:

1. **Overview** — high-level health cards for the selected session (active skill, telemetry, activity graph), plus cross-session summaries (total/active/pinned sessions, top skills, top tools, recent sessions).
2. **Sessions** — sortable, filterable, pinnable session list. Pinned sessions stay at the top and persist in `localStorage`.
3. **Timeline** — reverse-chronological tool invocations (newest at top). A `tool_start` and its matching `tool_end` are collapsed into one row that changes color from running (blue) to success (green) or error (red). Rows can be expanded to view sanitized `input` and `output`; rows with no details show a fallback message. Events can be copied to the clipboard or exported as JSON.
4. **Network** — interactive 3D force-directed graph (`react-force-graph-3d`) that creates a distinct skill node for each skill used during the session, linking tools and files to the specific skill active at the time. Nodes are colored by type (skill, tool, file) and sized by activity weight. The layout respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
5. **Files** — two-pane Explorer layout with a file list (indicating read/edit/other badges with premium selection highlights) and a viewer that dynamically switches between code reader format (with line numbers for read operations) and diff comparison format (for edits).
6. **Skills** — aggregate skill, tool, and file usage for the selected session's visible invocations.
7. **Settings** — user preferences for theme (`system`/`dark`/`light`), density (`comfortable`/`compact`), reduced motion, auto-follow active session, and max events per session. Settings persist to `localStorage`.

## Command palette

A global command palette is triggered by `Cmd/Ctrl+K` or the search button in the top bar. It provides fuzzy search across views, sessions, skills, tools, files, recent events, and actions (e.g., export JSON, toggle density, open settings). Selecting an item executes its action and closes the palette. The palette traps focus while open.

## Filters

A shared filter bar appears on list and graph views. Filters apply to invocations and sessions by:

- **Source** — agent source.
- **Skill** — active skill name.
- **Status** — `running`, `success`, `error`.
- **Tool** — individual tool name.
- **Operation type** — `read`, `edit`, `other`.
- **Time range** — `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `24h`, `session`, or `all`.

Filter state is global and ephemeral (not persisted across reloads).

## Skill inference

The dashboard does **not** guess a skill from generic tool usage. `SkillInferenceEngine` decides the active skill for a session using only these signals, in order:

1. **Explicit skill change** — `event_type: skill_change` with a known `skill`.
2. **Skill tool invocation** — `tool: Skill` with a known skill name in `detail`.
3. **Git heuristic** — `tool: Bash` with a git command (`commit`, `push`, `branch`, `merge`, `tag`, `checkout`) maps to `shipper`.
4. **Preserve existing explicit skill** — once a session has an explicit skill, it is kept until another explicit signal arrives.
5. **No match** — `activeSkill` is left undefined and the UI shows a "no active skill" state.

## Implementation notes

- Source adapters live in `servers/dashboard/src/adapters/`.
- Shared normalization and HTTP forwarding live in `servers/dashboard/src/adapters/shim.ts`.
- Sanitization lives in `servers/dashboard/src/filters/sanitize.ts`.
- View-model helpers live in `servers/dashboard/src/lib/` and are tested with Node's built-in test runner.
- The React UI lives in `servers/dashboard/ui/`, is built by Vite into `dist/public/`, and is served by the dashboard server on `http://127.0.0.1:7890`.
- The server exposes:
  - `POST /event` for receiving hooks payloads.
  - `GET /api/skills` to fetch configured skills.
  - `GET /api/workspace-files` to fetch the list of relative workspace files.
  - `GET /api/file-content?path=...` to safely fetch full file contents.
  - `GET /api/file-diff?path=...` to safely fetch uncommitted git diffs relative to HEAD.
  - A WebSocket for live updates.
